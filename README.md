## Credits

I made use of our previous "Portfolio Generator" app as well as the "README Generator" for much of the logic in building this app.

I've also made use of the following sites/pages throughout the building of this app:

## Special Thanks

A big thank you to my instructors Ali, Devon and Mija, who each helped me get unstuck at various stages.
